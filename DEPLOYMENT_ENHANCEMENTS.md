       libjpeg-dev \
       libfreetype6-dev \
       zip \
       unzip
   RUN docker-php-ext-configure gd --with-freetype --with-jpeg
   RUN docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) gd mysqli pdo_mysql
   COPY . /var/www/html/
   RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
   ```

2. **Docker Compose for Development**:
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml
   version: '3'
   services:
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "80:80"
       volumes:
         - ./frontend:/var/www/html
       depends_on:
         - backend
         - db
     
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       volumes:
