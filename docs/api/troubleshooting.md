# API Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you troubleshoot common issues with the GigGatek API.

## Authentication Issues

### Issue: "Invalid or expired token" error

**Possible causes:**
1. The token has expired (tokens expire after 45 minutes)
2. The token is malformed or invalid
3. The token has been revoked

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh your token using the `/auth/refresh` endpoint
2. Log in again to get a new token
3. Check that you're including the token correctly in the `Authorization` header:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
   ```
4. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in your token

### Issue: "Insufficient permissions" error

**Possible causes:**
1. Your user account doesn't have the required permissions for the requested action
2. You're trying to access a resource that belongs to another user

**Solutions:**
1. Check the required permissions for the endpoint in the API documentation
2. Contact your administrator to request additional permissions
3. Verify that you're accessing the correct resource (e.g., check the ID in the URL)

## Request Issues

### Issue: "Validation failed" error

**Possible causes:**
1. Missing required fields
2. Invalid field values
3. Incorrect data types

**Solutions:**
1. Check the error response for specific validation errors:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "validation_error",
     "message": "Validation failed",
     "status": 400,
     "errors": [
       {
         "field": "email",
         "message": "Invalid email format"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
2. Refer to the API documentation for the required fields and their formats
3. Ensure all required fields are included in your request
4. Check that field values match the expected format (e.g., dates in ISO 8601 format)

### Issue: "Resource not found" error

**Possible causes:**
1. The requested resource doesn't exist
2. The resource ID is incorrect
3. The resource has been deleted

**Solutions:**
1. Verify that the resource ID is correct
2. Check if the resource exists using a GET request
3. If you're trying to access a recently created resource, it might not be available immediately due to eventual consistency

### Issue: "Method not allowed" error

**Possible causes:**
1. Using the wrong HTTP method for the endpoint
2. The endpoint doesn't support the requested method

**Solutions:**
1. Check the API documentation for the correct HTTP method for the endpoint
2. Ensure you're using the correct endpoint for the desired action

## Rate Limiting Issues

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded" error

**Possible causes:**
1. Sending too many requests in a short period
2. Multiple applications sharing the same API credentials

**Solutions:**
1. Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
2. Cache responses when appropriate to reduce the number of API calls
3. Optimize your code to batch requests when possible
4. Check the rate limit headers in the API response:
   ```
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 120
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
   X-RateLimit-Reset: 30
   ```
5. Wait until the rate limit resets before sending more requests
6. Consider upgrading to a higher tier with higher rate limits

## Connection Issues

### Issue: Connection timeout or network error

**Possible causes:**
1. Network connectivity issues
2. API server is down or experiencing high load
3. Firewall or proxy blocking the connection

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify that the API endpoint URL is correct
3. Check the API status page for any reported outages
4. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. Check if your network has firewall rules blocking the API domain
6. Try connecting from a different network or using a VPN

### Issue: Slow API responses

**Possible causes:**
1. Large response payloads
2. API server under high load
3. Network latency
4. Complex queries

**Solutions:**
1. Use pagination to request smaller chunks of data
2. Specify only the fields you need using field selection parameters
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. Optimize your queries by using more specific filters
5. Consider using a CDN for static resources

## Data Issues

### Issue: Missing or incorrect data in responses

**Possible causes:**
1. Data hasn't been synchronized yet (eventual consistency)
2. Caching issues
3. Bug in the API

**Solutions:**
1. Wait a few moments and try the request again
2. Add a cache-busting query parameter (e.g., `?_=timestamp`)
3. Check if you're using the correct API version
4. Report the issue to GigGatek support with detailed reproduction steps

### Issue: Unexpected field values or formats

**Possible causes:**
1. Misunderstanding of the API documentation
2. API changes or updates
3. Bug in the API

**Solutions:**
1. Review the API documentation for the expected field formats
2. Check for any recent API changes in the changelog
3. Implement more flexible parsing logic to handle variations in the response format
4. Report the issue to GigGatek support if you believe it's a bug

## Webhook Issues

### Issue: Webhooks not being received

**Possible causes:**
1. Incorrect webhook URL configuration
2. Webhook endpoint is not publicly accessible
3. Webhook endpoint is returning errors
4. Webhook events are not being triggered

**Solutions:**
1. Verify that the webhook URL is correctly configured in your GigGatek account
2. Ensure your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible
3. Check your webhook endpoint logs for any errors
4. Implement logging in your webhook handler to track incoming requests
5. Test your webhook endpoint with a tool like RequestBin or Webhook.site
6. Check if your server's firewall is blocking incoming webhook requests

### Issue: Webhook signature verification failing

**Possible causes:**
1. Incorrect webhook secret
2. Timestamp skew between servers
3. Incorrect signature verification implementation

**Solutions:**
1. Verify that you're using the correct webhook secret
2. Ensure your server's clock is synchronized
3. Check your signature verification code against the documentation
4. Implement more lenient timestamp validation (e.g., allow for a few minutes of skew)

## Client Library Issues

### Issue: Client library throwing unexpected errors

**Possible causes:**
1. Outdated client library version
2. Bug in the client library
3. Incompatible dependencies

**Solutions:**
1. Update to the latest version of the client library
2. Check the client library's GitHub repository for known issues
3. Review your code for correct usage of the client library
4. Consider using the raw HTTP API if the client library is problematic

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Debugging API Requests

For detailed debugging, you can use tools like cURL with verbose output:

```bash
curl -v -X GET https://api.giggatek.com/api/v1/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

This will show the complete HTTP request and response, including headers.

### Using API Sandbox Environment

For testing and troubleshooting, use our sandbox environment:

```
https://sandbox-api.giggatek.com/api/v1
```

The sandbox environment:
- Doesn't affect production data
- Has higher rate limits for testing
- Provides test accounts and data
- Supports test payment methods

### Logging and Monitoring

Implement comprehensive logging for API interactions:
1. Log all API requests and responses (excluding sensitive data)
2. Track response times and error rates
3. Set up alerts for unusual error rates or response times
4. Use correlation IDs to track requests across systems

### Getting Support
