# 95th percentile response time
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))

# CPU usage by container
sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) by (container_name)

# Memory usage by container
container_memory_usage_bytes{container_name=~".+"} / container_spec_memory_limit_bytes{container_name=~".+"} * 100

# Disk space remaining
(node_filesystem_avail_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes) * 100
```

### Common Elasticsearch Queries

```
# Failed payments
component:payment AND status:failed

# HTTP 5xx errors
http.response.status_code:>=500

component:database AND duration:>1000

# Authentication failures
type:auth AND outcome:failure

# High severity errors
