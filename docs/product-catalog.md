This document describes the product catalog system implemented in the GigGatek platform.

## Overview

The product catalog system provides a rich and interactive shopping experience for users. It includes detailed product information, image galleries, reviews, and related product recommendations.

## Key Components

### ProductDetailEnhancement

The `ProductDetailEnhancement` class enhances product detail pages with additional functionality:

```javascript
class ProductDetailEnhancement {
    constructor() {
        // Product state
        this.productId = this.getProductIdFromUrl();
        this.productData = null;
        this.selectedOptions = {};
        this.quantity = 1;
        
        // UI elements
        this.imageGallery = null;
        this.specificationTabs = null;
        this.reviewsSection = null;
        
        // Initialize
        this.init();
    }
    
    // ... methods for product detail enhancement
}
```

### ImageGallery

The `ImageGallery` class creates an interactive image gallery with zoom functionality:

```javascript
class ImageGallery {
    constructor(container, images) {
        this.container = container;
        this.images = images || [];
        this.currentIndex = 0;
        
        // Initialize
        this.init();
    }
    
    // ... methods for image gallery
}
```

### ProductReviews

The `ProductReviews` class handles product reviews display and submission:

```javascript
class ProductReviews {
    constructor(container, productId) {
        this.container = container;
        this.productId = productId;
        this.reviews = [];
        this.page = 1;
        this.totalPages = 1;
        this.perPage = 5;
        this.sortBy = 'newest';
        this.filterRating = 0;
        
        // Initialize
        this.init();
    }
    
    // ... methods for product reviews
}
```

### ProductCarousel

The `ProductCarousel` class creates a carousel for displaying product lists:

```javascript
class ProductCarousel {
    constructor(container, products, title = '') {
        this.container = container;
        this.products = products || [];
        this.title = title;
        this.currentIndex = 0;
        this.itemsPerSlide = 4;
        
        // Initialize
        this.init();
    }
    
    // ... methods for product carousel
}
```

### TabSystem

The `TabSystem` class creates a tabbed interface for content:

```javascript
class TabSystem {
    constructor(container) {
        this.container = container;
        this.tabs = [];
        this.activeTab = null;
        
        // Initialize
        this.init();
    }
    
    // ... methods for tab system
}
```
