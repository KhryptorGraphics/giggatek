# GigGatek Deployment Modernization: Getting Started

This guide provides concrete next steps for implementing the deployment modernization plan outlined in the `DEPLOYMENT_NEXT_STEPS.md` document. It focuses on practical implementation tasks and establishes a clear migration path from the traditional deployment described in `MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT.md` to the modern containerized approach.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have the following tools installed on your development machine:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Terraform (v1.0.0+)
- Ansible (v2.9+)
- AWS CLI (if using AWS)
- GitHub CLI (optional, for GitHub Actions setup)

## Phase 1: Local Development Environment Setup

Start by implementing the containerized development environment to establish a foundation for consistency across all environments.

### Step 1: Initial Repository Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git giggatek
   cd giggatek
   ```

2. Create a feature branch for Docker implementation:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/docker-implementation
   ```

### Step 2: Test Docker Configuration

1. Build and start the local development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Verify the services are running correctly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

3. Access the services:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:80
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
   - Adminer (database admin): http://localhost:8080
   - MailHog (email testing): http://localhost:8025

4. Make any necessary adjustments to the Docker configuration files.

### Step 3: Document Development Workflow

Create a `DOCKER_DEVELOPMENT.md` file explaining:
- How to start the local environment
- Common development commands
- Debugging tips
- Testing procedures

### Step 4: Team Onboarding

1. Conduct a workshop to train the development team on the Docker workflow
2. Update onboarding documentation to include Docker setup instructions
3. Set up a sandbox environment for team members to practice Docker commands

## Phase 2: CI/CD Implementation

Once the local development environment is stabilized, implement the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Repository

1. Push the Docker configuration to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add docker/ docker-compose.yml
   git commit -m "Add Docker configuration for development environment"
   git push origin feature/docker-implementation
   ```

2. Create a pull request and merge to the main branch after review.

3. Set up required GitHub repository secrets:
   - `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`
   - `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`
   - `STAGING_HOST`
   - `STAGING_USERNAME`
   - `STAGING_SSH_KEY`
   - `PRODUCTION_HOST`
   - `PRODUCTION_USERNAME`
   - `PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY`

### Step 2: Configure CI/CD Workflow

1. Create the GitHub Actions directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Add the workflow configuration file:
   ```bash
   # .github/workflows/ci.yml already created
   ```

3. Push the CI/CD configuration:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Create Staging Environment

1. Set up a staging server using your preferred cloud provider
2. Deploy the initial Docker stack to staging:
   ```bash
   # On the staging server
   mkdir -p /opt/giggatek-staging
   cd /opt/giggatek-staging
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/giggatek/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with staging configuration values
4. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Step 4: First Automated Deployment

1. Make a small change to the application code
2. Push to the develop branch to trigger the CI/CD pipeline
3. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow execution
4. Verify the change is deployed to staging

## Phase 3: Production Migration Planning

With the CI/CD pipeline working for staging, plan the migration of the production environment from the traditional deployment to the containerized approach.

### Step 1: Infrastructure Preparation

1. Update the Terraform configuration with your specific requirements:
   ```bash
   # Customize terraform/variables.tf
   ```

2. Initialize and plan the Terraform deployment:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan -var-file=production.tfvars -out=production.plan
   ```

3. Review the plan carefully before proceeding.

### Step 2: Create Migration Schedule

1. Create a detailed migration plan with:
   - Timing (preferably during off-peak hours)
   - Database backup strategy
   - Fallback procedures
   - Stakeholder communication plan
   - Validation tests

2. Schedule a maintenance window and notify users.

### Step 3: Migration Dry Run

1. Create a clone of the production database in a test environment
2. Run through the migration steps in the test environment
3. Document any issues encountered and update the migration plan

### Step 4: Production Migration

1. Execute the Terraform plan to create new infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply production.plan
   ```

2. Deploy the application using Ansible:
   ```bash
   cd ansible
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/production.yml playbook.yml
   ```

3. Verify all services are running correctly
4. Perform database migration if needed
5. Switch DNS records to point to the new infrastructure
6. Monitor the system closely for the first 24-48 hours

## Phase 4: Monitoring Implementation

Once the containerized production environment is stable, enhance it with comprehensive monitoring.

### Step 1: Set Up Prometheus and Grafana

1. Deploy the monitoring stack using the prepared configurations:
   ```bash
   cd monitoring
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Import pre-configured dashboards to Grafana
3. Set up alert notifications (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)

### Step 2: Configure Log Aggregation

1. Deploy the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation
2. Configure log shipping from all application components
3. Create dashboards for common log analysis tasks

### Step 3: Implement Health Checks

1. Add health check endpoints to all microservices
2. Configure uptime monitoring with external providers (e.g., Pingdom, UptimeRobot)
3. Set up alerting for critical services

## Phase 5: Security Enhancements

With the infrastructure modernized and monitoring in place, focus on security improvements.

### Step 1: Add Security Scanning to CI/CD

1. Configure dependency scanning tools
2. Add SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools
3. Implement container scanning for known vulnerabilities

### Step 2: Database Encryption

1. Implement encryption at rest for the database
2. Configure encryption for sensitive fields in the database
3. Update the application code to handle encrypted data correctly

### Step 3: Network Security

1. Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules
2. Configure network security groups with minimal required access
3. Set up VPN for administrative access to infrastructure

## Phase 6: Documentation and Training

Ensure all team members understand the new infrastructure and can operate it effectively.

### Step 1: Update Documentation

1. Create detailed architecture diagrams
2. Document all operational procedures
3. Update disaster recovery and business continuity plans

### Step 2: Conduct Training

1. Organize workshops for development and operations teams
2. Create video tutorials for common tasks
3. Establish a knowledge base for troubleshooting
