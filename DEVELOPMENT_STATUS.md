- Payment processing workflow in checkout flow
- Webhook handling for payment events (`webhook.php`)
- Styling consistent with platform design system (`stripe-elements.css`)
- Documentation for implementation and maintenance (`STRIPE_SETUP.md`)

### Integration Points

The payment system integrates with:
- Shopping cart for one-time purchases
- Rental system for recurring payments
- Order system for payment status tracking

- Responsive layout system with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Standardized form components with validation
- Consistent color scheme and typography

## Backend Development Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Product Endpoints | âœ… Complete | GET endpoints for products and single product |
| User Authentication | ðŸŸ¥ Planned | Endpoints defined but not implemented |
| Order Management | ðŸŸ¥ Planned | Basic structure in place, needs implementation |
| Rental Management | ðŸŸ¥ Planned | Framework exists, needs implementation |
| Admin API | ðŸŸ¨ Partial | Product and order management implemented |
| Payment Integration | âœ… Complete | Stripe integration with webhook support |

### Database Models

- Product model implemented
- Order, User, Rental models defined but need implementation
- Payment model newly implemented for Stripe integration

## Deployment Readiness

The deployment configuration is well-documented with comprehensive instructions for:
- Server setup on Ubuntu 22.04
- Apache configuration with SSL
- MySQL database setup
- Security hardening measures
- Backup strategy
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and logging
- Stripe webhook configuration

## Authentication System Implementation

The backend authentication system has been implemented in `auth/routes.py` with the following components:

- JWT-based authentication with token generation and validation
- User registration endpoint with email/password validation
- Login endpoint with credential verification
- Token refresh mechanism for session management
- Password reset request and completion flow
- Protected route middleware (token_required decorator)
- Admin authorization checks (admin_required decorator)
- User profile update functionality

The system uses bcrypt for password hashing and includes robust validation for email formats and password strength. Authentication state is maintained through JWT tokens with configurable expiration.

## Order Management Implementation

Order management has been implemented in `orders/routes.py` with a comprehensive API:

- Order listing with pagination and filters
- Detailed order information retrieval
- Order creation with inventory verification
- Order cancellation with inventory restoration
- Admin-only status update functionality
- Order statistics for user dashboards

The system includes transaction handling to ensure data integrity between order creation, inventory updates, and payment processing.

## Rental Contract System

The rental management system is implemented in `rentals/routes.py` with features including:

- Rental contract creation and management
- Payment scheduling and tracking
- Contract signing functionality
- Early buyout options
- Rental statistics for dashboards

The system includes a comprehensive payment tracking mechanism and generates rental contracts automatically.

## Email Notification Framework

An email notification system has been implemented in `utils/email.py` providing:

- Transactional email sending via SMTP
- Template-based email generation
- Async email delivery to prevent blocking
- Specialized functions for different notification types
- Batch processing for scheduled notifications

Several email templates have been created in `templates/emails/`, but additional templates are still needed.

## Critical Path Items

Based on the actual implementation status, the following items are now the highest priorities to reach a minimum viable product:

1. **Authentication Integration Testing** - Verify frontend-backend auth connections work properly
2. **Order Flow Testing** - Ensure complete order lifecycle functions correctly
3. **Rental Contract UI Integration** - Test the full rental creation and management flow
4. **Complete Email Template Set** - Implement remaining email templates
5. **End-to-End Testing** - Verify all components work together properly

## Technical Debt

Current areas requiring attention:

- **Documentation-Implementation Mismatch** - Project documentation doesn't reflect actual implementation status
- **Email Template Completion** - Several required email templates still need to be created
- **Frontend-Backend Integration** - Components exist but need integration testing
- **API Response Standardization** - Ensure consistent response formats across all endpoints
- **Error Handling Enhancement** - Improve error handling in payment and rental flows
- **Testing Coverage** - Implement comprehensive test suite for implemented components
- **Environment Configuration** - Document required environment variables for all components

## Next Sprint Recommendations

1. **Conduct Authentication Integration Testing** - Verify frontend auth.js connects properly with JWT backend
2. **Test Complete Order Flow** - Validate order creation, processing, and status updates
3. **Verify Rental Contract UI Flow** - Test rental creation, contract signing, and payment integration
4. **Complete Email Templates** - Implement remaining notification templates
5. **Standardize API Error Handling** - Ensure consistent error responses across all endpoints
6. **Update Technical Documentation** - Bring documentation in line with implementation status

## Technical Debt

Current areas requiring attention:
- Update backend DEVELOPMENT.md to reflect completed Stripe integration
- Address error handling in payment processing 
- Standardize API response formats
- Implement test suite for payment processing
- Review security considerations for payment data

## Deployment Requirements

The application is ready for staging deployment with the following requirements:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server
- 4GB+ RAM
- Apache 2.4+ with mod_rewrite
- MySQL 8.0+
- PHP 8.1+ with required extensions
- Python 3.10+ with Flask
- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- Stripe account with webhook configuration
