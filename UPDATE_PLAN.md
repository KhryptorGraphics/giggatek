   - Implement GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up environment-specific deployment pipelines

2. **Containerization**
   - Create Docker containers for development environments
   - Set up Docker Compose for local development
   - Prepare for containerized production deployment

3. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Implement automated unit testing for backend components
   - Add end-to-end testing for critical user flows
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints
