   - Prepare production data
   - Create deployment runbook

3. **Final Integration Testing**
   - Conduct end-to-end testing
   - Validate integration points
   - Address any remaining issues

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Execute in planned maintenance window
   - Follow deployment runbook
   - Monitor closely during cutover

5. **Post-Deployment Support**
   - Monitor application performance
   - Address any issues immediately
   - Gather user feedback

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Implement security hardening tasks as highest priority |
| Production deployment issues | High | Medium | Thorough testing and detailed runbook |
| Monitoring blind spots | Medium | Low | Validate monitoring coverage before production |
| Performance issues at scale | Medium | Medium | Load testing before production deployment |
| Integration failures | High | Low | Comprehensive integration testing |

## Conclusion

The GigGatek e-commerce platform implementation has made significant progress with all core functionality, infrastructure, and testing components complete. The remaining tasks primarily involve security hardening and production deployment.

The integration testing framework most recently implemented ensures systematic verification of all critical component interactions, providing confidence in the system's reliability and stability.

By focusing next on security hardening and production preparation, the platform will be ready for a successful launch with robust security, monitoring, and operational processes in place.
